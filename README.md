# Memory Partition Allocation Vizualizer

In this project, I developed a web-based tool that enables users to visualize different memory partition allocation strategies, including First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, and Next Fit. This tool is designed to help computer science students better understand the concept of memory partition allocation by providing them with a hands-on, interactive experience.

Using this tool, users can simulate the allocation of memory partitions based on their preferred strategy and visualize the results in real-time. They can also explore different scenarios by adjusting various parameters such as memory size and the number of processes.


Overall, the Memory Partition Allocation Visualizer is a valuable resource for anyone looking to gain a deeper understanding of memory management in computer systems. Its interactive, visual approach makes it an engaging and effective learning tool for students.
